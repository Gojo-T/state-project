## 1. Data Handling
### Key Concepts
- Handling missing data using methods like:
  - **Imputation** (mean, median, mode).
  - Removing rows/columns with excessive missing values.
- Converting data types to ensure compatibility, improve performance, and avoid errors.

### Example Use Case
Preparing a sales dataset by:
- Filling missing values in sales columns with the median.
- Ensuring the time column is in the correct datetime format.

---

## 2. Statistical Analysis
### T-Test
- A statistical test for comparing means between two groups.
- **Example:** Comparing average sales revenue between two regions to determine if differences are statistically significant.

### Chi-Square Test for Independence
- Used to test relationships between two categorical variables.
- **Example:** Testing if shipping mode (e.g., Standard, Express) is independent of customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).

---

## 3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
### Univariate Analysis

- Focuses on one variable.
- **Example:** Analyzing the distribution of monthly sales revenue using histograms or boxplots.

### Bivariate Analysis
- Examines relationships between two variables.
- **Example:** Exploring the correlation between advertising spend and monthly sales using scatterplots and correlation coefficients.

## 4. Data Visualization
### Correlation Matrix
- **Benefits:**
  - Summarizes relationships between multiple variables.
  - Identifies highly correlated features for predictive modeling.
- **Example:** Visualizing the correlation between sales, profit, and advertising spend.

## 5. Sales and Profit Analysis
### Identifying Top-Performing Product Categories
- **Steps:**
  - Aggregate sales and profit by product category.
  - Rank categories to identify high-performing products.
- **Example:** A bar chart displaying total sales and profit for each category.

### Analyzing Seasonal Trends
- Use time series analysis to decompose sales data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
- **Example:** Detecting peak sales periods during holidays.

---

## 6. Grouped Statistics
### Importance
- Analyzing grouped statistics provides insights into patterns and differences across categories.
- **Example:** Calculating total sales, average profit margin, and transaction counts by region to identify high-performing markets.

### Visualization
- Use bar charts or heatmaps for comparing regional performance.
- **Example:** A dual-axis plot showing total sales and average profit margin for each region.
